# 🌟 Learning Project: Building a One-Page Retail Product Website with React

## 🚀 Project Overview

I recently built a one-page retail product website using React. This project showcases various React functionalities and best practices.

## 💻 Features

- **Home Page**: Displays all products with a left-side navigation bar for category filtering. Users can click on categories to filter products.
- **Product Details**: Each product has a detail page where users can edit or delete items.
- **Add New Product**: An "Add New Product" button allows users to add new items with a simple form.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Product Display**: Utilized `map()` to display products efficiently and `filter()` for category sorting.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented dynamic routes like `product/:id` to allow for product-specific pages, using `useParams` to extract the ID.
- **Data Fetching**: Data is fetched with Axios.
- **State Management**: Used Context API to manage global state.

## 🧠 Key Lessons Learned

- Using functional components effectively
- Mastering data flow with Context API
- Implementing React Router for dynamic paths
- Handling API calls and managing real-time data

This project deepened my understanding of React, and I'm excited to continue learning and building more projects!
